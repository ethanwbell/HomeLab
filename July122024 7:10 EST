Update 7/12/24 7AM EST

I have started to try to use the NSA 4600 for firewall and routing. 
I have only just now learned that I will need to rebuild the config once again on my switch. I used switch port access originally, 
and while it worked within the limited environment of the switch; my main goals to set up SSIDS that correspond to vlans would not be possible without trunking. 
So I began my educating myself in that. Eventually I also wanted to make the SSIDs accessible via 
an Access Point, and depending on which SSID you join, it would assign an IP that matches the allowed range for each segment.  
And keep traffic isolated to each segment(the point of the vlan) for security. 

On booting the NSA4600 I was unable to PuTTY into it. Upon investigation I had chosen the wrong speed, 9600 baud instead of 115,200 baud. 
I was able to connect but it would refuse my request to access port or transmit/receive data. I will try to factory reset the NSA4600.
I would like to get comfortable with this gear and maybe replace it with my SFF Dell PC running pfSense. I would be limiting my speed to a ethernet adapter NIC,
not really a concern at this point but still a consideration. But I am more focused on understanding and laying out a network over speeds and efficiency.

I have decided to start and document the process behind me building my home lab. This is something I have wanted to do for a while.
As a novice in documenting my workflows, please excuse any formatting and layout inconsistencies in this document.

>Have Cisco 3750-X

Goals: Build configuration for my home lab with security in mind. Vlans for segmentation, dedicated SFP for internet access. Use Mac filtering, uplink, ACL to control traffic. 
Once Completed I wish to add as a node to my Wazuh Dashboard - long term goal after I complete the home lab.

Has previous PW protected configuration 

All attempts to switch into ROMMOM failed

Investigated and found mode switch to be broken on PCB

Shorted pads to enter ROMMON mode

Renamed config and have booted back into iOS

Info:
  Enter host name [Switch]: Switch

  Enter enable secret: ethan
  
  Enter enable password: ethan2  

  Enter virtual terminal password: ethan3

  Vlan1: IP: 192.168.92.1 <-- should change this using x.x.x.1 for router (using x.x.92.x for static IP)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Vlan config: 

Vlan1:Management for switch
Vlan2:Management for networking gear
Vlan3:Trusted Devices
Vlan4: IoT (all)
Vlan5:Guest/CCTV/Sandbox

### While in execute mode in CLI(enable)
### Enter the config terminal using 'configure terminal' command

### Then follow process of command per line

Vlan X <-- this changes directory to the vlan
name XXXXXX <-- changes name of the directory 
exit <--- exits directory of chosen vlan

### Now to assign ports on my switch to each vlan 

Interface range gi3/0/1-12 <-- essentially changes directory or chooses this range of ports
switchport mode access 
switchport access vlan X
Exit
